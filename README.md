## Assignment
### Scenario
Your company has recently decided to standardize all front-end projects using Bootstrap to ensure consistency and maintainability. As part of this initiative, your team has been tasked with refactoring existing projects that were previously styled with custom CSS. You will be revisiting a few of your earlier projects and converting them to use Bootstrap, ensuring that they look consistent and function well across various devices.

You will start with smaller projects, such as a QR Code Component and a Blog Preview Card, and then move on to a more complex, multi-page website project if time allows. This refactoring process is a common task in professional web development and will prepare you to handle similar scenarios in your workplace.

### Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Refactor an existing project using Bootstrap’s utility classes.
- Use Bootstrap components to replace custom-styled elements.
- Apply Bootstrap’s grid system for responsive layouts.
- Demonstrate the ability to leverage Bootstrap documentation for efficient development.

## Reflection Questions
Once you have completed refactoring the projects, take a moment to review your work. Consider the following questions:

1. What challenges did you face when refactoring your code to use Bootstrap?



2. How did using Bootstrap utility classes and components simplify your styling process?



3. In what scenarios might you choose not to use Bootstrap and write custom CSS instead?
